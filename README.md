# Body Signals of Smoking on AWS with Terraform

This project predicts smoking habits using biomedical health markers, leveraging a Random Forest model and an interactive Streamlit interface, deployed on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.

## Deployment on AWS with Terraform

- **Cloud Infrastructure**:
  - **AWS S3**: Stores `smoking.csv` and files in `smoking-body-signals-data-dev`.
  - **AWS EC2**: A t2.micro instance runs the Streamlit app (accessible at `http://<public_ip>`).
  - **AWS RDS (optional)**: MySQL database for model metrics in `eu-central-1`.
- **Terraform**:
  - **main.tf**: Configures AWS resources (S3, EC2, RDS) for the deployment.
  - **variables.tf**: Defines variables like the region (`eu-central-1`), environment (`dev`), and RDS password.
  - **outputs.tf**: Provides outputs such as the S3 bucket name (`smoking-body-signals-data-dev`), EC2 public IP, and RDS endpoint.

## AWS Deployment Instructions

1. Configure AWS CLI with `aws configure` using the `eu-central-1` region.
2. Clone this repository and run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply` from the `/terraform` folder.
3. Upload `smoking.csv` and files to S3 with `aws s3 cp data/raw/smoking.csv s3://smoking-body-signals-data-dev/data/raw/` and `aws s3 cp src/ s3://smoking-body-signals-data-dev/src/ --recursive`.
4. Connect to EC2, install dependencies, and run `streamlit run src/app.py --server.port 80 --server.address 0.0.0.0`.

## Screenshots
- [Images of the app on EC2 (http://3.66.168.76:8501/), S3 bucket, terraform apply output].

## Improvements
1. Needs to improve the security with https://
2. Needs to be able to connect RDS and with MySQL

# Body Signals of Smoking - Data Science Project

This project aims to predict smoking habits using bodily signals and biomarkers. By leveraging a Random Forest Classifier trained on biomedical data—such as hemoglobin, cholesterol, and blood pressure—the system classifies individuals as smokers or non-smokers. A user-friendly Streamlit application allows users to input their data via sliders and dropdowns, delivering real-time predictions. This tool supports early detection of smoking behaviors and contributes to public health initiatives for smoking prevention.

## Notebook Breakdown: `Project_smoking_Body_Signals.ipynb`

The Jupyter notebook (`Project_smoking_Body_Signals.ipynb`) is the core exploratory and modeling environment for this project. Below is a detailed breakdown of its sections and what was accomplished in each:

1. **Introduction and Objective**:
   - Defines the project's goal: predicting smoking status using health markers.
   - Links to the Kaggle dataset and outlines the purpose of the analysis.

2. **Imports**:
   - Loads essential Python libraries for:
     - **EDA and Visualization**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
     - **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn` (e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`, `StandardScaler`), `xgboost`, `pycaret`.
   - Includes fixes for font issues in Matplotlib visualizations.

3. **Loading Data**:
   - Reads the raw dataset (`smoking.csv`) from `data/raw/` into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Displays initial rows (`head()`) to inspect the data structure.

4. **First Blick (Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA)**:
   - **Overview**: Examines data format, features (e.g., gender, hemoglobin), and target variable (`smoking`).
   - **Actions**:
     - Checks dataset shape (55,692 rows, 27 columns) and data types (`info()`).
     - Identifies categorical (e.g., `gender`, `tartar`) and numerical features.
     - Flags potential preprocessing needs (e.g., encoding categoricals, handling missing values).
   - **Insights**: Confirms no missing values and highlights the need for further visualization.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Purpose**: Visualizes relationships between features and smoking status.
   - **Actions**:
     - Generates plots (e.g., heatmaps, bar charts) to explore correlations and distributions.
     - Highlights trends like higher hemoglobin or triglyceride levels in smokers.
   - **Output**: Visuals used in the Streamlit app’s "Relevant Data" section.

6. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**:
   - **Actions**:
     - Encodes categorical variables (e.g., `gender`: F/M to 0/1, `tartar`: N/Y to 0/1).
     - Scales numerical features using `StandardScaler` for model compatibility.
     - Splits data into training and testing sets (`train_test_split`).
   - **Output**: Prepares `total_data_c2.csv` in `data/processed/` for modeling.

7. **Model Development**:
   - **Approach**: Tests multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) using `scikit-learn` and `pycaret`.
   - **Focus**: Optimizes a Random Forest Classifier as the final model.
   - **Actions**:
     - Trains the model on scaled data.
     - Saves the trained model as `randomforest_default_42.pkl` in `models/`.
   - **Tools**: Uses `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning (if applicable).

8. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Actions**:
     - Generates predictions (`y_pred_random`) on the test set.
     - Computes a confusion matrix using `confusion_matrix`.
     - Calculates metrics: Accuracy (83.22%), Sensitivity (79.76%), Specificity (85.36%).
   - **Visualization**: Creates a heatmap of the confusion matrix with true positives (TP), false positives (FP), etc.
   - **Conclusions**: Confirms Random Forest as the best performer for this dataset.

9. **Conclusions**:
   - Summarizes model performance and its implications for smoking prediction.
   - Notes the balance between sensitivity and specificity, indicating reliable classification.

## Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- No temporal or geographic context for the data.
- Limited demographic and behavioral variables.

### Potential Enhancements
1. Add demographic data (e.g., education, income).
2. Include physiological markers (e.g., exhaled CO levels).
3. Incorporate behavioral data (e.g., smoking frequency).
4. Account for cultural and environmental factors.
5. Use user feedback to refine the model and UI.
